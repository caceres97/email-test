# Backend Challenge

ðŸ’« Hello There! ðŸŽ‰
There is my email test, I dedicated just 2h in that, but I did my best!
I have to say that I've never touched email manipulation, but this exercise gives a lot of ideas of to implement in future projects, for example real-time mails analysis with AI, or create a summary of my large mails using IA too, this exercise was interesting and funny, thanks for the chance.

For installation just: 
```bash
  npm i
```

To run the project:

```bash
  npm start
```
